## Getting Started

First thing first, make sure you've clone the back-end code base to your local machine, so we can run the whole contact list app locally:
[Clone the back-end repo](https://github.com/resumecompanion/taroko_server.git)

At the back-end folder, run
```
npm install
npm run start-prod
```

After having the back-end up and running, 
now we can `cd` to `contactlist_frontend` folder,
run the front-end dev server by 

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3333](http://localhost:3333) with your browser to see the result.
